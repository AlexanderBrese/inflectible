A java library for user interface internationalization and localization. It allows writing texts
that use grammatically appropriate word forms (lexemes). It is based on user-written
vocabularies, and also text corpuses (collections of translations to a specific language)
that consult vocabularies for a correct lexeme. The approach it uses is not completely
correct in a linguistic sense, but it provides an easy way to translate applications
(particularly games with full-blown ontologies) to multiple languages where usage of correct word
forms is crucial (more crucial than in English).
